## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first time I created a layout from a design.  I learned the beginnings of a workflow from the approach suggested in the Frontend 
Mentor README.  I was able to apply some basic CSS concepts that I have learned, building more comfortability with CSS in general.  I also touched 
for the first time on media queries, hsl colors, and responsive design without the use of Bootstrap.


### Continued development

For now, my focus is on building a strong foundation in the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I have much to learn, and hope to build
familiarity and comfortability with the basics.  I am also eager to learn and adopt best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.
I look forward to viewing other solutions for this challenge as I am sure to find more efficient and cleaner practices that I can learn from and
apply to my next challenge.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - I am still a novice, learning the basics of front end development. This is my go-to resource.
